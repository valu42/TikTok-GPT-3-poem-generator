# TikTok GPT-3 Poem Generator

## Introduction

This is a project designed for automated poetry video generation. The program uses GPT-3 for generating poems with a given theme. The primary script `main.py` overlays these poems onto videos and OpenAI TTS for narration. Additionally, `combine.py` allows for the assembly of these individual videos into compilations. I got this idea from seeing automated Reddit TTS video generator ( https://github.com/HA6Bots/Automatic-Youtube-Reddit-Text-To-Speech-Video-Generator-and-Uploader)

## Usage

How to use the main functionalities of the project:
- Running `main.py` to generate poems, overlay them on videos, and use text-to-speech.
- Using `combine.py` to create video compilations.

## Configuration

Details on setting up environment variables (like OpenAI API key).

## Development ideas
At some point I'm going to develop a better prompt and upgrade to using GPT-4. At the moment I'm still not convinced about the current poems so I'm probably going to wait a bit before doing that.

In the land of Teletubby, the sun was shining bright,
As the four friends went about their day, everything just right.
But little did they know, they had stumbled upon some magic flowers,
That would soon have them feeling high for hours and hours.

First, Tinky Winky tripped and fell, landing right on top,
Of a patch of the brightly colored blooms, that made him hop and hop.
He giggled and laughed, as he felt a strange sensation,
Like his body was filled with joy and elation.

Next, Dipsy stumbled upon the flowers, and gave a curious sniff,
Before he too was overcome by the plant's delightful gift.
He began to dance and spin, his movements wild and free,
As the effects of the flowers took hold, and he felt completely carefree.

Laa-Laa and Po were the last to find the flowers,
But they too were soon caught up in the magic, for hours and hours.
They sang and played, as if they were in a dream,
Their troubles and worries all forgotten, it seemed.

The day passed quickly, and the sun began to set,
As the four Teletubbies, finally free from the flowers' grip, did get,
Ready for bed, with smiles on their faces,
Grateful for the joy and happiness the flowers had traced.

And though they didn't know what had happened, or why,
They knew that they would always cherish the memories of that high,
As they drifted off to sleep, with happy hearts and minds,
In the land of Teletubby, where love and joy always shines.
